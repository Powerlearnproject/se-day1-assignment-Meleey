# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
is a computer science that deals wiyth designs, development, testing and maintenance of software applications.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
machine code and language, cloud-computing, and web applications.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
feasibility- can work be completed on time, budget.
requirements analysis- build a complete required specification approved by the customer prior to design and work.
design- mapping requirements to logical and physical designs
code- writing, reusecode, unyt testing and demonstration
test- ensure system works properly
deploy- release to the production environment for users to begin operations
operating and maintenance- support operationsbegin here,to ensure smooth operation of the system, software fixes are done here too

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall has linear and sequential approaches where each phase must be completed before moving to the next while Agile is iterative and flexible where it allows for customer feedback and adjustments throughout the process. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer- plan, create, test, and releases new software and modules
quality assurance- examine programs to identify bugs and defects
project manager- plans and oversee everything from execution to delivery

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
allows you to perform common operations like committing and branching without leaving your IDE. For example, in Visual Studio Code, you can stage changes, commit, create branches, merge branches, and even resolve merge conflicts directly in the editor



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
technological changes- continous learning is required
debugging- finding and fixing errors

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing -examining individual code components, 
integration testing -checking how different components interact, 
system testing -evaluating the entire system functionality, 
acceptance testing -verifying if the system meets user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
is the process of guiding generative AI solutions to generate outputs this helps AI models produce accurate, relevant and useful outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
